### About

Refactored version (lol) of `hax.c` with the smash/buffer lenghts given
as program args.

Also refactored the library so isntead of shell it exits() with 
a distinct return code.

Like this it can be used in combination with bruteforcing script,
to blindly try getting the .so execution.

In theory it should **eventually** work, in practice you might want to go 
get some time with your wife while it's running and then return back to
having completely no hit at all.

The `bruteforce.py` is the main script, it's as simple as it gets
pretty nasty but with a bit of polish here and there.

### Just Run It 

```
make
python3 bruteforce.py
```

If you get no hit with the defaults, you will have to increase 
the ranges and try (them all) again.

### bruteforce.py notes

To see return codes as well as args of each run,
uncomment the print exactly in the middle of the loops 
at `bruteforce.py:L60` (and comment the one under it).

Like this it can function as a small fuzzer to spot interesting 
errors as SIGSEGV (-11) 
(sometimes, like in the middle of the run, it starts asking for a password...).

Then use the reported args with `sudo gdb --args ./baron <> <> <> <>`. 
It will act as a proxy, setting env and all the options exactly as needed,
and then you can step away as much as you want.


**todo** (only if it gets some traction):
- doc: how to custom ranges 
- or refactor ranges and stuff, also argparse and stuff like verbose mode 
(prints commented out right now to save that few python-heavy print cycles)
- could be parallelized to make it faster (asyncio, threading, golang and so on)
- save/restore already tried combinations, pickle with a set of sets?


### Tested

```
ubuntu/focal64 (vagrant) - sudo 1.8.31, libc 2.31
 - ['./baron', '53', '56', '64', '209']
 - ['./baron', '53', '57', '63', '209'] (well, but hey it works)

manjaro - sudo 1.9.5p1, libc 2.31
- 0 hits, seems to have different order of LC malloc/free calls making the 
heap holes in bad places (?), pobably because of the logging refactor that happened between 1.8-1.9 (??)
```
